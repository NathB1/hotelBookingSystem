# hotelBookingSystem
Online hotel booking system. HTML5/CSS, Javascript, Jquery, XML, AJAX, PHP

NOTE: Still need to implement a login logout feature.

To see the full functionality:
  look at index.php = user view
  
from there you will see "administrator" --> you usually wont be able to see this if the login feature works if you are not logged in.
  
One you are logged in you will be able to view all the admin pages including removing bookings etc.
